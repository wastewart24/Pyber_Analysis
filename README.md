# Pyber_Analysis

# Overview

   A client who works for a ride-sharing company, Pyber, has asked me to create a summary DataFrame of their ride-sharing data by city type. They also want a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type. These visualizations will help summarize how the data is different between city types and how it can be used for future decisions at Pyber.

# Results

   The figure below is a summary Dataframe categorized by city type.

   The data shows that Urban cities have more than double the number of rides combined to Rural and Suburban cities combined. Also, Suburban cities have on average five times more rides than Rural cities. This information makes sense as more people live in Urban cities and many of them do not own personal transportation.

   Because of this demand, the total number of drivers in each city type is proportional to the amount of rides given. It is worth noting that there are significantly more drivers in Urban cities than the total number of rides given. This could mean that many of them are inactive and/or cannot obtain the number of rides they desire.

   The average fares per ride in Rural and Suburban areas are higher than Urban areas most likely because the riders need to travel longer distances since public goods are a farther distance out in the country. Many riders in Urban cities may only need to go a couple miles around the city each ride. This also reflects in the average fare per driver as it is higher for Suburban to Urban and then Rural to Suburban.

   The chart below shows the toal fare by city type from Jan to April of 2019.

  The chart is consistent with the Dataframe in that Urban cities consistently have more fares when compared to Suburban cities. Also, Suburban cities make more fares than Urban cities. There are not significant trends in the data, other than all the areas had a slight bump in fares at the end of February.

# Summary
    
   After analyzing the data, I have prepared the following recommendations to the CEO of Pyber about the disparities of the city types.

   1. There is very low demand for rides in the Rural cities. If the company wishes to keep a presence in those areas, they must increase marketing in the area and provide promotions for riders to increase demand. If this does not raise the total fares to expectations, they may want to consider focusing more on cities with higher populations.

   2. The total number of drivers in urban cities far exceeds the total number of rides given. There could be a number of reasons for this like inactivity for some drivers or just a higher demand of drivers. In order to meet this demand, the company should heavily increase marketing in urban cities. Many of the drivers most likely drive as a full-time job and are not satisfied with an average fair of just $16.57 per ride.

   3. The company needs to gather data for the rest of the year in order to make better decisions about what to do and invest in for each city type. I would be happy to assist the company in performing this analysis so I can provide more accurate recommendations for the CEO on what decisions to make in the future.
